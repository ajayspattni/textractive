                This is my first article. I am going to write about how the life looks at 180 quit a different topic to write.
Let me tell you why i am choosing this topic, as i am experiencing this life now
Metro little heavy world with lots of meaning. Well, lets going deep into what the life at metro and how people live in the metro.
You might think that living in a big city is a big deal, but nonthing like that.
Mostly, the villagins have the dream to live in big city. They are coming in the metros with so many dreams about the career job, study. We will become this and that , but actually living in metros is very difficult for that people.
People just attract with the infrastructures modern facilitities and modern outlook. This results in increase in population of these cities . the growth of these cities affect the culture also . people are too much forward and buzy in their own life.
They don’t even time for their family.life in a metro city looks a bed of roses from the outside, but in reality people here suffer from lots of stress and tension.
Life is too fast here. If we wait for someone we are going to thrown out somewhere. Just no time for even talk.
Only one rutine that they have to follow whole day and night nonthing new in life. People are so selfish and busy with their own rutine.
Is it a beautiful life style ? Just ignore outside beauty and think once,your heart will definitely says No
There is good and positive side as well as negative side too frankly speaking  living in a big city without family is quit challenging one side is that living in a big city is more comfortable cinemas,museums ,pubs restaurents and that isnot enough lots of places specially for yougester.
Its also quite easy to find a job in these but people are faceless in this metros. No emotions and helpful nature towards others, only 10 % people are having different thinking of living otherwise no body have time to help the others.
Definitely, we must see the positive side but i will give you one advise that always accept and enjoy positive side and take care with negative side.
Just tell you at the end that don’t change your nature and personality whether you are in small town or a big city.

                    <u><b>FEELING OF HOMESICKNESS</b></u>
                    <br />
                    <font size="3px"><b>Release Date :</b></font>
                </p>

                <p align="justify">
                    Can you imagine your life without home and family ?  The clear answer is “NO”.  Nobody can live without their family and the importance of family can only feel after we leave them.
Its too bad feelings of homesickness.  Really,  parents is a great support and root of our life. After leaving the home people can understand the value of their family.  
Let’s take one live example. One  girl, who was never been alone and always staying with her family.  She laugh, she cry, she enjoy whole day with family no worries, no complaints. Just beautiful life with family.
Suddenly she has to shift somewhere for her better carrier. Now the suffering begins. She is too dependent on parents. How she manage all things alone.  Because in every stage of her life she need parents. She realice the importance of her family. What awesome days that was at home.
This short story might be match many of girls story. Who is leaving outside for their carrier.
Is our carrier is important than our family ?  one request for you please never hurt your parents and always make them happy in any condition. Because they are the real hero of our life.
The feeling of homesickness is too dangerous. Stay with your parents and always fulfill their dream. There is a popular saying, “Home is the end of earth”  Always be with family and feel happy.
Another beautiful quote is, “There is no home as comfortable as your father’s arms and no bed as soft its really true”.
We thought that small kids only feels homesick, but partially everyone feels homesick, even adults.
We are used to with the familiar surroundings, people and routines provide a security and comfort .  In a new place, we really find ourself missing the comforts at home.
